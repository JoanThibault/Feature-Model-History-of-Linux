    Pull libnvdimm updates from Dan Williams:
     "The bulk of this has appeared in -next and independently received a
      build success notification from the kbuild robot.  The 'for-4.5/block-
      dax' topic branch was rebased over the weekend to drop the "block
      device end-of-life" rework that Al would like to see re-implemented
      with a notifier, and to address bug reports against the badblocks
      integration.
    
      There is pending feedback against "libnvdimm: Add a poison list and
      export badblocks" received last week.  Linda identified some localized
      fixups that we will handle incrementally.
    
      Summary:
    
       - Media error handling: The 'badblocks' implementation that
         originated in md-raid is up-levelled to a generic capability of a
         block device.  This initial implementation is limited to being
         consulted in the pmem block-i/o path.  Later, 'badblocks' will be
         consulted when creating dax mappings.
    
       - Raw block device dax: For virtualization and other cases that want
         large contiguous mappings of persistent memory, add the capability
         to dax-mmap a block device directly.
    
       - Increased /dev/mem restrictions: Add an option to treat all
         io-memory as IORESOURCE_EXCLUSIVE, i.e. disable /dev/mem access
         while a driver is actively using an address range.  This behavior
         is controlled via the new CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM option and can be
         overridden by the existing "iomem=relaxed" kernel command line
         option.
    
       - Miscellaneous fixes include a 'pfn'-device huge page alignment fix,
         block device shutdown crash fix, and other small libnvdimm fixes"
