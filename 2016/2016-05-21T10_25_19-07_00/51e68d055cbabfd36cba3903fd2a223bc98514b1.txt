    x86 isa: add back X86_32 dependency on CONFIG_ISA
    
    Commit b3c1be1b789c ("base: isa: Remove X86_32 dependency") made ISA
    support available on x86-64 too.  That's not right - while there are
    some LPC-style devices that might be useful still and be based on
    ISA-like IP blocks, that is *not* an excuse to try to enable any random
    legacy drivers.
    
    Such drivers should be individually enabled and made to perhaps depend
    on ISA_DMA_API instead (which we have continued to support on x86-64).
    Or we could add another "ISA_XYZ_API" that we support that doesn't
    enable random old drivers that aren't even 64-bit clean nor do we have
    any test coverage for.
    
    Turning off ISA will now also turn off some drivers that have been
    marked as depending on it as part of this series, and that used to work
    on modern platforms.
    
    See for example commits ad7afc38eab3..cc736607c86d, which may also need
    to be reverted.
    
    This commit means that the warnings that came in due to enabling ISA
    widely are now gone again.
