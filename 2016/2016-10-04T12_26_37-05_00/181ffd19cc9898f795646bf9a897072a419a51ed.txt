commit 181ffd19cc9898f795646bf9a897072a419a51ed

    x86/PCI: VMD: Move VMD driver to drivers/pci/host
    
    Move the driver source and Kconfig to the PCI host bridge drivers directory
    and move the config option to a more appropriate sub-menu instead of
    occupying the top-level location.
    
    Update the Kconfig option with the X86_64 dependency that was implicitly
    included from the previous location, and add information about the module
    name when built as a loadable module.
