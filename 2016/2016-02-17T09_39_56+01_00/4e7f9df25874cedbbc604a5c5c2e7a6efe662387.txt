    hpet: Drop stale URLs
    
    Looks like the HPET spec at intel.com got moved.
    It isn't hard to find so drop the link, just mention
    the revision assumed.

 Each HPET has one fixed-rate counter (at 10+ MHz, hence "High Precision")
 and up to 32 comparators.  Normally three or more comparators are provided,
