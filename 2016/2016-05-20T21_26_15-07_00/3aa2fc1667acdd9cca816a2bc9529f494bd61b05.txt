    Pull driver core updates from Greg KH:
     "Here's the "big" driver core update for 4.7-rc1.
    
      Mostly just debugfs changes, the long-known and messy races with
      removing debugfs files should be fixed thanks to the great work of
      Nicolai Stange.  We also have some isa updates in here (the x86
      maintainers told me to take it through this tree), a new warning when
      we run out of dynamic char major numbers, and a few other assorted
      changes, details in the shortlog.
    
      All have been in linux-next for some time with no reported issues"
