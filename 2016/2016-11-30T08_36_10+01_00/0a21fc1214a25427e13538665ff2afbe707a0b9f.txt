    sched/x86: Make CONFIG_SCHED_MC_PRIO=y easier to enable
    
    Right now CONFIG_SCHED_MC_PRIO has X86_INTEL_PSTATE as a dependency,
    which is not enabled by default and which hides the CONFIG_SCHED_MC_PRIO
    hardware-enabling feature.
    
    Select X86_INTEL_PSTATE instead, plus its dependency (CPU_FREQ), if the
    user enables CONFIG_SCHED_MC_PRIO=y.
    
    (Also align the CONFIG_SCHED_MC_PRIO Kconfig help text in standard style.)
