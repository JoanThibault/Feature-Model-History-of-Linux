    Merge branch 'x86-urgent-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
     "A bit on the largish side due to a series of fixes for a regression in
      the x86 vector management which was introduced in 4.3.  This work was
      started in December already, but it took some time to fix all corner
      cases and a couple of older bugs in that area which were detected
      while at it
    
      Aside of that a few platform updates for intel-mid, quark and UV and
      two fixes for in the mm code:
       - Use proper types for pgprot values to avoid truncation
       - Prevent a size truncation in the pageattr code when setting page
         attributes for large mappings"
