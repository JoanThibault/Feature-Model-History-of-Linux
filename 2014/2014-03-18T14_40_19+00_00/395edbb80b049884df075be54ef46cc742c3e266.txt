    xen: remove XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST
    
    This patch removes the Kconfig symbol XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST which is
    used nowhere in the tree.
    
    We do know grub2 has a script that greps kernel configuration files for
    its macro. It shouldn't do that. As Linus summarized:
        This is a grub bug. It really is that simple. Treat it as one.
    
    Besides, grub2's grepping for that macro is actually superfluous. See,
    that script currently contains this test (simplified):
        grep -x CONFIG_XEN_DOM0=y $config || grep -x CONFIG_XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST=y $config
    
    But since XEN_DOM0 and XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST are by definition equal,
    removing XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST cannot influence this test.
    
    So there's no reason to not remove this symbol, like we do with all
    unused Kconfig symbols.
