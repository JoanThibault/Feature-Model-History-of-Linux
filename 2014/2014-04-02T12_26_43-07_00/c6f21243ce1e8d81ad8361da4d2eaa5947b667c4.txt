    Merge branch 'x86-vdso-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 vdso changes from Peter Anvin:
     "This is the revamp of the 32-bit vdso and the associated cleanups.
    
      This adds timekeeping support to the 32-bit vdso that we already have
      in the 64-bit vdso.  Although 32-bit x86 is legacy, it is likely to
      remain in the embedded space for a very long time to come.
    
      This removes the traditional COMPAT_VDSO support; the configuration
      variable is reused for simply removing the 32-bit vdso, which will
      produce correct results but obviously suffer a performance penalty.
      Only one beta version of glibc was affected, but that version was
      unfortunately included in one OpenSUSE release.
    
      This is not the end of the vdso cleanups.  Stefani and Andy have
      agreed to continue work for the next kernel cycle; in fact Andy has
      already produced another set of cleanups that came too late for this
      cycle.
    
      An incidental, but arguably important, change is that this ensures
      that unused space in the VVAR page is properly zeroed.  It wasn't
      before, and would contain whatever garbage was left in memory by BIOS
      or the bootloader.  Since the VVAR page is accessible to user space
      this had the potential of information leaks"
