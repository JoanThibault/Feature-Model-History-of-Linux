    x86, mpx: Give MPX a real config option prompt
    
    Give MPX a real config option. The CPUs that support it (referenced
    here):
    
      https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/402393
    
    are not available publicly yet. Right now only the software emulator
    provides MPX for the general public.
    
    [ tglx: Make it default off. There is no point in having it on right
            now as no hardware and no proper tooling support are available ]

+	  MPX provides hardware features that can be used in
+	  conjunction with compiler-instrumented code to check
+	  memory references.  It is designed to detect buffer
+	  overflow or underflow bugs.
+
+	  This option enables running applications which are
+	  instrumented or otherwise use MPX.  It does not use MPX
+	  itself inside the kernel or to protect the kernel
+	  against bad memory references.
+
+	  Enabling this option will make the kernel larger:
+	  ~8k of kernel text and 36 bytes of data on a 64-bit
+	  defconfig.  It adds a long to the 'mm_struct' which
+	  will increase the kernel memory overhead of each
+	  process and adds some branches to paths used during
+	  exec() and munmap().
