commit 4a474157747ab7c4432ac269247e0e0e15f85584
Author: Robert Graffham <psquid@psquid.net>

    Kconfig: update flightly outdated CONFIG_SMP documentation
    
    Remove an outdated reference to "most personal computers" having only one
    CPU, and change the use of "singleprocessor" and "single processor" in
    CONFIG_SMP's documentation to "uniprocessor" across all arches where that
    documentation is present.
