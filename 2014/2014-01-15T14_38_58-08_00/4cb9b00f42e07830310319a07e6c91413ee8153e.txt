    x86, intel-mid: Remove deprecated X86_MDFLD and X86_WANT_INTEL_MID configs
    
    We want to support all Intel MID (Mobile Internet Device) platforms
    with a single config selection. This patch removes deprecated
    CONFIG_X86_MDFLD and X86_WANT_INTEL_MID options in favor of having
    CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MID only.
