    Merge branch 'x86-cache-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 cache quality monitoring update from Thomas Gleixner:
     "This update provides a complete rewrite of the Cache Quality
      Monitoring (CQM) facility.
    
      The existing CQM support was duct taped into perf with a lot of issues
      and the attempts to fix those turned out to be incomplete and
      horrible.
    
      After lengthy discussions it was decided to integrate the CQM support
      into the Resource Director Technology (RDT) facility, which is the
      obvious choise as in hardware CQM is part of RDT. This allowed to add
      Memory Bandwidth Monitoring support on top.
    
      As a result the mechanisms for allocating cache/memory bandwidth and
      the corresponding monitoring mechanisms are integrated into a single
      management facility with a consistent user interface"
