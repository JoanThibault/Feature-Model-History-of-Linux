    Merge branch 'x86-platform-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 PCI updates from Thomas Gleixner:
     "This update provides the seperation of x86 PCI accessors from the
      global PCI lock in the generic PCI config space accessors.
    
      The reasons for this are:
    
       - x86 has it's own PCI config lock for various reasons, so the
         accessors have to lock two locks nested.
    
       - The ECAM (mmconfig) access to the extended configuration space does
         not require locking. The existing generic locking causes a massive
         lock contention when accessing the extended config space of the
         Uncore facility for performance monitoring.
    
      The commit which switched the access to the primary config space over
      to ECAM mode has been removed from the branch, so the primary config
      space is still accessed with type1 accessors properly serialized by
      the x86 internal locking.
    
      Bjorn agreed on merging this through the x86 tree"
