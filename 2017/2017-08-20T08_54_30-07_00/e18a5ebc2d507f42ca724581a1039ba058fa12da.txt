    Pull watchdog fix from Thomas Gleixner:
     "A fix for the hardlockup watchdog to prevent false positives with
      extreme Turbo-Modes which make the perf/NMI watchdog fire faster than
      the hrtimer which is used to verify.
    
      Slightly larger than the minimal fix, which just would increase the
      hrtimer frequency, but comes with extra overhead of more watchdog
      timer interrupts and thread wakeups for all users.
    
      With this change we restrict the overhead to the extreme Turbo-Mode
      systems"
