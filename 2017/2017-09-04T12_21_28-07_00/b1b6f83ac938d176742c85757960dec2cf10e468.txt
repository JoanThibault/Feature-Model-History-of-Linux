    Merge branch 'x86-mm-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 mm changes from Ingo Molnar:
     "PCID support, 5-level paging support, Secure Memory Encryption support
    
      The main changes in this cycle are support for three new, complex
      hardware features of x86 CPUs:
    
       - Add 5-level paging support, which is a new hardware feature on
         upcoming Intel CPUs allowing up to 128 PB of virtual address space
         and 4 PB of physical RAM space - a 512-fold increase over the old
         limits. (Supercomputers of the future forecasting hurricanes on an
         ever warming planet can certainly make good use of more RAM.)
    
         Many of the necessary changes went upstream in previous cycles,
         v4.14 is the first kernel that can enable 5-level paging.
    
         This feature is activated via CONFIG_X86_5LEVEL=y - disabled by
         default.

       - Add 'encrypted memory' support, which is a new hardware feature on
         upcoming AMD CPUs ('Secure Memory Encryption', SME) allowing system
         RAM to be encrypted and decrypted (mostly) transparently by the
         CPU, with a little help from the kernel to transition to/from
         encrypted RAM. Such RAM should be more secure against various
         attacks like RAM access via the memory bus and should make the
         radio signature of memory bus traffic harder to intercept (and
         decrypt) as well.
    
         This feature is activated via CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT=y - disabled
         by default.
    
         (By Tom Lendacky)
    
       - Enable PCID optimized TLB flushing on newer Intel CPUs: PCID is a
         hardware feature that attaches an address space tag to TLB entries
         and thus allows to skip TLB flushing in many cases, even if we
         switch mm's.
    
         (By Andy Lutomirski)
    
      All three of these features were in the works for a long time, and
      it's coincidence of the three independent development paths that they
      are all enabled in v4.14 at once"
