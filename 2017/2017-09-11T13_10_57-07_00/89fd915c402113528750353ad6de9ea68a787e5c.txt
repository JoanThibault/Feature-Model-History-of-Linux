    Pull libnvdimm from Dan Williams:
     "A rework of media error handling in the BTT driver and other updates.
      It has appeared in a few -next releases and collected some late-
      breaking build-error and warning fixups as a result.
    
      Summary:
    
       - Media error handling support in the Block Translation Table (BTT)
         driver is reworked to address sleeping-while-atomic locking and
         memory-allocation-context conflicts.
    
       - The dax_device lookup overhead for xfs and ext4 is moved out of the
         iomap hot-path to a mount-time lookup.
    
       - A new 'ecc_unit_size' sysfs attribute is added to advertise the
         read-modify-write boundary property of a persistent memory range.
    
       - Preparatory fix-ups for arm and powerpc pmem support are included
         along with other miscellaneous fixes"
