    Merge branch 'x86-pmem-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull PMEM driver from Ingo Molnar:
     "This is the initial support for the pmem block device driver:
      persistent non-volatile memory space mapped into the system's physical
      memory space as large physical memory regions.
    
      The driver is based on Intel code, written by Ross Zwisler, with fixes
      by Boaz Harrosh, integrated with x86 e820 memory resource management
      and tidied up by Christoph Hellwig.
    
      Note that there were two other separate pmem driver submissions to
      lkml: but apparently all parties (Ross Zwisler, Boaz Harrosh) are
      reasonably happy with this initial version.
    
      This version enables minimal support that enables persistent memory
      devices out in the wild to work as block devices, identified through a
      magic (non-standard) e820 flag and auto-discovered if
      CONFIG_X86_PMEM_LEGACY=y, or added explicitly through manipulating the
      memory maps via the "memmap=..." boot option with the new, special '!'
      modifier character.
    
      Limitations: this is a regular block device, and since the pmem areas
      are not struct page backed, they are invisible to the rest of the
      system (other than the block IO device), so direct IO to/from pmem
      areas, direct mmap() or XIP is not possible yet.  The page cache will
      also shadow and double buffer pmem contents, etc.
    
      Initial support is for x86"
