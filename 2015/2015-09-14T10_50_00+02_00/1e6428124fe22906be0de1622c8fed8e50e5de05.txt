    x86/vm86: Fix the misleading CONFIG_VM86 Kconfig help text
    
    The CONFIG_VM86 Kconfig help text is actively misleading, so fix it:
    
      - Don't mark it 'obsolete' in the text as we'll support the ABI as long as CPUs
        support it.
    
      - Qualify the part about software emulation and mention that for some apps you
        want a real vm86 mode.
    
      - Don't scare users away from the option, instead explain what it does.
