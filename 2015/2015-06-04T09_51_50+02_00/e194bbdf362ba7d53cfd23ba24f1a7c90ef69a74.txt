    kvm: x86: default legacy PCI device assignment support to "n"
    
    VFIO has proved itself a much better option than KVM's built-in
    device assignment.  It is mature, provides better isolation because
    it enforces ACS, and even the userspace code is being tested on
    a wider variety of hardware these days than the legacy support.
    
    Disable legacy device assignment by default.
